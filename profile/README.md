## What ⚡
Strategies & Code to Help Orgs with Knowledge Sharing & Team Collaboration

## Why 🤷‍♂️
Knowledge management is challenging and failures in this area have a significant negative impact on project and organization outcomes. One of the chief ways to fail with this system is to not have system or standard for execution.

## How 📋
We're publising all the code we write and all the learnings we gather we help us with our own knowledge sharing within this Github org. You may use it all too and make your own contributions!
