## What ⚡
Strategies & Code to Help Orgs with Knowledge Sharing & Team Collaboration
💡⌨️ -> 🏢 -> 🧠🤝
## Why 🤷‍♂️
Knowledge management is challenging and failures in this area have a significant negative impact on project and organization outcomes. 

One of the chief ways to fail with this system is to not have system. 

This repository is about documenting options related to management in an effort to create an optimal standard of execution that can be followed within our own organization, and yours too!
## How 📋
We'll publish our code here as we investigate static and dynamic team collaboration tools and methods of using them effectively. 

Connecting all the distinct dots made by a team to create a beautiful final product.
